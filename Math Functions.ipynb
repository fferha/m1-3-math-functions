Take your time as needed reading through this definition:\n","\n","Let $A,B$ be sets, and let $F$ be a subset of $A × B$. We say that $F$ is a function if it satisfies the following property: for each $a ∈ A$, there is a unique pair $(a, b) ∈ F$ (an input must have exactly one output). To denote this, we use the arrow notation $F : A → B$. \n","\n","Remember that $A × B$ is the cartesian product between A and B as we saw before. We'll also often say that $F$ \"maps\" $A$ into $B$ (hence the arrow pointing from $A$ into $B$).\n","\n","So the square function above can be written as the following map:\n","\n","$$F = \\{(1,1),(2,4),(3,9),(4,16),...\\} = \\{(x,x^2) : x ∈ \\mathbb{N}\\}$$\n","\n","So we see thata function is a set of *input-output pairs*. The set $A$ is called the domain (AKA inputs or arguments) of $F$ and $B$ is called the range (outputs) of $F$.\n","\n","The cleanest way to represent a function is with a map container, called the `Dict` in python:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"v9lNw8qQ9ixS","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595278198228,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":772,"user":{"displayName":"Matthieu Ranger","photoUrl":"","userId":"05160963434497794589"}},"outputId":"38d8d68b-89b6-45ef-bf65-27edef7bed76"},"source":["square_map = {\n","    1: 1,\n","    2: 4,\n","    3: 9,\n","    4: 16,\n","}\n","\n","square_map[3]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["9"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":1}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HJauhJ5i_vkH","colab_type":"text"},"source":["This is often used to map elements in a dataset in one step:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"VTtGpapa_vt1","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":104},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595278198231,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":749,"user":{"displayName":"Matthieu Ranger","photoUrl":"","userId":"05160963434497794589"}},"outputId":"e461c62c-f4cf-436d-d819-2927424de199"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","pd.Series([1,2,3,4]).map(square_map)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0     1\n","1     4\n","2     9\n","3    16\n","dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ggtMVWqT9jDD","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**NOTE:** The term *map* is fairly ambiguous in mathematics and programming it can refer to:\n","\n","- A function (a mapping)\n","\n","- A dictionary object representing a mapping (a map object)\n","\n","- Applying a function over a set of elements (like in the pandas code above, a map-application)\n","\n","----\n","\n","Functions often have to handle infinite numbers of input-output pairs. \n","\n","For example, the *square* function above should preferably work on all real numbers.\n","\n","In fact, most interesting functions work on infinite sets, so pure functions are a basic construct in any programming language:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sTDApTDZIhhm","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# We can define a function with the `def` statement\n","def square(x):\n","  return x ** 2\n","\n","# Let's make it a bit more explanatory:\n","def square(x: float) -> float:\n","  \"\"\"Square a number\"\"\"\n","  return x ** 2"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"g9UUk8OYR4p3","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Note a few things going on here:\n","\n","0) We give inline documentation with [docstrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring).
